Ryan Adler and his twin sister, Jane, spent their happiest childhood days at their parents' mountain Colorado cabin---until divorce tore their family apart. Now, with the house about to be sold, the Adler twins gather with their closest friends for one last snowboarding-filled holiday. While commitment-phobic Ryan gazes longingly at Lauren, wondering if his playboy days are over, Jane's hopes of reconciling with her old boyfriend evaporate when he brings along his new fianc√©e. As drama builds among the friends, something lurks in the forest, watching the cabin, growing ever bolder as the snow falls...and hunger rises.

After a blizzard leaves the group stranded, the true test of their love and loyalty begins as the hideous creatures outside close in, one bloody attack at a time. Now Ryan, Jane, and their friends must fight---tooth and nail, bullet and blade---for their lives. Or else surrender to unspeakable deaths in the darkened woods.
