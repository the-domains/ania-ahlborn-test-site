## A terrifying new e-novella from the bestselling author of Within These Walls and The Bird Eater!

New York, 1977\. The sweltering height of the Summer of Sam. The entire city is gripped with fear, but all Nell Sullivan worries about is whether or not she'll ever make a friend. The self-proclaimed "Plain Jane" does her best to fit in with the girls at work, but Nell's brother, Barrett, assures her that she'll never be like them. When Nell manages to finally garner some much-yearned-for attention, the unthinkable happens to her newfound friend. The office pool blames Son of Sam, but Nell knows the awful truth...because doing the devil's work is easy when there's already a serial killer on the loose.
